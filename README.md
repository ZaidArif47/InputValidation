# InputValidation

The first user-input is for an email.

In the isValidEmail function 

Here the regular expression '/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/'

/ and /: These forward slashes / are delimiters that enclose the regular expression pattern. In JavaScript, you often define regular expressions by placing them between forward slashes.

^: The caret ^ asserts the start of the string. It means that the string being matched must begin with what follows.

[^\s@]+: This part of the regular expression can be broken down as follows:

[ ]: Square brackets are used to define a character set. In this case, it's used to specify a set of characters that are allowed.
^: Inside the character set, the caret ^ when used as the first character (not as a start-of-string assertion) negates the character set. 
   It means "match anything that is not in this set."
\s: \s represents any whitespace character, such as spaces, tabs, or line breaks.
@: This is a literal "@" symbol.
So, [^\s@] means "match any character that is not a whitespace character or "@"."

+: The + quantifier means "match one or more of the preceding element." In this case, it means "match one or more characters that are not whitespace or "@"."
@: This is a literal "@" symbol. It's not part of the regular expression pattern but is used to specify that an "@" symbol is expected in the email address.

[^\s@]+: This part is similar to the second part, and it again means "match one or more characters that are not whitespace or "@"."

\.: This is a literal period (dot) character. Since the dot has a special meaning in regular expressions (it matches any character), 
    it needs to be escaped with a backslash \ to match a literal period.

[^\s@]+: Similar to the previous occurrences, this part again means "match one or more characters that are not whitespace or "@"."

$: The dollar sign $ asserts the end of the string. It means that the string being matched must end with what precedes it.

So, when you put it all together:

^[^\s@]+ matches one or more characters that are not whitespace or "@" at the start of the string.
@ matches a literal "@" symbol.
[^\s@]+ matches one or more characters that are not whitespace or "@" in the middle of the string.
\. matches a literal period (dot) character.
[^\s@]+ matches one or more characters that are not whitespace or "@" at the end of the string.
$ asserts that the string ends here.

This regular expression is used to validate that an email address follows a basic format with at least one character before and after the "@" symbol, 
and it has a period (dot) separating the domain. It does not perform a comprehensive validation of all possible valid email addresses but serves as a basic check for format. 
More complex email validation regular expressions can be used for stricter validation if needed.


In the last line: return emailPattern.test(emailValue);

The test method is a built-in JavaScript method available for regular expressions. 
It checks whether the provided string (email in this case) matches the pattern defined by the regular expression. 
It returns true if there's a match and false if there isn't.

This line combines the regular expression test with the return statement. 
It executes the test method on the email string using the emailPattern expression and returns the result as the value of the isValidEmail function.
If the email string matches the pattern defined by emailPattern, test returns true, indicating that the email is considered valid according to the regular expression's format.
If the email string does not match the pattern, test returns false, indicating that the email does not meet the expected format.

We then use the returned value as condition for isValidEmail function.

In the second user-input

The return statement in the onsubmit attribute of a form element is used to control whether the form should be submitted or not 
based on the return value of a JavaScript function. Here's how it works:

Form Submission Event: When a user submits a form by clicking a submit button or pressing Enter in an input field, the browser triggers a form submission event.

onsubmit Attribute: The onsubmit attribute of the <form> element allows you to specify a JavaScript function to be executed when the form is submitted.

JavaScript Function: In the onsubmit attribute, you provide the name of a JavaScript function (in this case, validateForm()) that should be called when the form is submitted.

return Statement: Inside the JavaScript function (validateForm() in this case), you can use the return statement to specify whether the form should proceed 
with its default submission behavior (e.g., sending data to the server and navigating to a new page) or whether it should be prevented from submitting.

If the function returns true, the form submission proceeds as usual.
If the function returns false, the form submission is prevented, and the default behavior is blocked.

In this case:

<form onsubmit="return validateForm()" action="Welcome.html">
    <!-- Form elements -->
</form>

When the user submits the form, the validateForm() function is called.
Inside validateForm(), if the conditions (e.g., checking if fields are empty) are met, it returns true.
If the conditions are not met (e.g., fields are empty), it returns false.
If validateForm() returns true, the form submission continues, and the browser navigates to the "Welcome.html" page (as specified in the action attribute of the <form>). 
If validateForm() returns false, the form submission is prevented, and the user stays on the current page.

This mechanism allows you to perform custom validation and control whether a form should be submitted based on the results of that validation. 
It's commonly used to ensure that form data meets certain criteria (e.g., fields are not empty) before allowing submission.
